# bnmonitor

`bnmonitor` is a package for sensitivity analysis and robustness in
Bayesian networks (BNs). If you use the package in your work please
consider citing as

``` r

#> To cite package 'bnmonitor' in publications use:

## Installation

The package `bnmonitor` can be installed from CRAN using the command

``` r
install.packages("bnmonitor")
```

and loaded in R with

``` r
library(bnmonitor)
```

Note that `bnmonitor` requires the package `gRain` which, while on CRAN,
depends on packages that are on Bioconductor both directly and through
the `gRbase` package, which depends on `RBGL`:

``` r
install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install(c("graph", "Rgraphviz", "RBGL"))
install.packages("gRain")
```

## Overview

`bnmonitor` provides a suite of function to investigate either a
data-learnt or an expert elicited BN. Its functions can be classified
into the following main areas:

- **Parametric sensitivity analysis**: Investigate the effect of changes
  in some of the parameter values in a Bayesian network and quantify the
  difference between the original and perturbed Bayesian networks using
  dissimilarity measures (both for discrete and Gaussian BNs).

- **Robustness to data**: Verify how well a Bayesian network fits a
  specific dataset that was used either for learning or for testing
  (only for discrete BNs).

- **Node influence**: Quantify how much the nodes of a Bayesian network
  influence an output node of interest (only for discrete BNs).

- **Edge strength**: Assess the strength of the edges of a Bayesian
  network (only for discrete BNs).

- **Other investigations**: Including the diameter of the conditional
  probability tables, measures of asymmetric independence, and level
  amalgamation.

<!-- The prequential diagnostics examine the forecasts that flow from a model in sequence. -->
<!-- Each monitor given below indicates the probability of a particular observation based on the previous observations and the model structure.  -->
<!-- In the prequential mindset, we compute a probability of each subsequent observation based on all previous data points.  -->
<!-- These observations are then scored, and in this package we use the logarithmic score function. -->
<!-- The observations are then standardized to give a z-score statistic.  -->
<!-- Following the recommendation of Cowell (2007), scores indicate a poor fit where |z| > 1.96  -->
<!-- We demonstrate the efficacy of the prequential monitors with the Asia data set from the bnlearn package. Details of the variables (nodes) can be found in the documentation for bnlearn. -->

Refer to the articles section for case studies showcasing the use of the
`bnmonitor` functions.
