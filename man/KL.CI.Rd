\title{KL Divergence for \code{CI}}
\usage{
\method{KL}{CI}(x, type, entry, delta, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object of class \code{CI}.}

\item{type}{character string. Type of model-preserving co-variation: either \code{"total"}, \code{"partial"}, \code{row},\code{column} or \code{all}. If \code{all} the KL divergence is computed for every type of co-variation matrix.}

\item{entry}{a vector of length 2 indicating the entry of the covariance matrix to vary.}

\item{delta}{numeric vector with positive elements, including the variation parameters that act multiplicatively.}

\item{...}{additional arguments for compatibility.}
}
\value{
A dataframe including in the first column the variations performed, and in the following columns the corresponding KL divergences for the chosen model-preserving co-variations.
}
\description{
\code{KL.CI} returns the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between an object of class \code{CI}  and its update after a model-preserving parameter variation.
}
\details{
Computation of the KL divergence between a Bayesian network and its updated version after a model-preserving variation.

KL(synthetic_ci, "total", c(1,1), seq(0.9,1.1,0.01))
KL(synthetic_ci, "partial", c(1,4), seq(0.9,1.1,0.01))
KL(synthetic_ci, "column", c(1,2), seq(0.9,1.1,0.01))
KL(synthetic_ci, "row", c(3,2), seq(0.9,1.1,0.01))
KL(synthetic_ci, "all", c(3,2), seq(0.9,1.1,0.01))
