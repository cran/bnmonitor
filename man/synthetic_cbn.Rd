\title{A synthetic continuous Bayesian network}
\format{
A continuous Bayesian networks over four variables ("y1", "y2", "y3", "y4"), embedding the statement "y1" independent of "y3" given "y2".
    The Bayesian network is available both as an object of class \code{GBN} and as an object of class \code{CI}.

An object of class \code{GBN} of length 3.

An object of class \code{CI} of length 4.
